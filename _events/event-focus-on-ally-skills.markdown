**Abstract**

Allyship in the workplace involves using your power, position, or privilege to uplift other coworkers.

Why should teaching ally skills be a core part of a modern workforce development program? 
This talk explains why focusing on teaching ally skills to people with power and influence is 
more effective than changing the behavior of marginalized people. It then describes a dozen specific 
ally skills such as listening, amplifying marginalized voices, and speaking up when it is uncomfortable. 
It ends with a 20 minute question and answer period.
