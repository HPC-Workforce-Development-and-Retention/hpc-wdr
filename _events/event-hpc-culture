Abstract
Issues and questions to be addressed in HPC are sufficiently complex 
and nuanced so that multiple perspectives, world views and lived experiences 
are needed to adequately attend to them. HPC is attractive as a field 
because of it appeals to individualsâ€™ unique curiosity, skills, 
and aptitude. Your whole, authentic self is an asset and a source of 
innovation. This talk with be a space for discussion about culture and 
identities and the ways in which they inform and guide our work.
