The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program recognizes and promotes leaders and 
advocates of high-quality software who foster practices, processes, and tools that help to improve 
scientific productivity and software sustainability. Each selected 2025 BSSw Fellow will receive up to 
$25,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software. Activities can include organizing a workshop, 
preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community, including broadening participation 
or promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Application Deadline: Applications for the 2025 BSSw Fellowship are being accepted through September 30, 2024. 
Those interested in applying are encouraged to participate in an informational fellowship webinar and Q&A session, 
scheduled for Tuesday, September 10, 2024, 2:00-3:00 pm EDT. Please subscribe to our 
[mailing list](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) for teleconference details and other updates on the program.
