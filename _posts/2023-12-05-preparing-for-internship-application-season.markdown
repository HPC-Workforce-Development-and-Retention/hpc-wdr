## Preparing for Internship Application Season

It is internship application season and many programs’ application deadlines are in early January.

Below are a few sections with details to help you prepare for next Summer:


### Resume Application Kit
- Obtain three recommendation letters from people familiar with your work. Contact professors and former mentors early for recommendations. Remind them of your work together and any achievements.
  - Refer to computer scientist Matthew Might's tips on asking for recommendation letters [here](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-recommendation-letter/).
     - Don’t worry if you haven’t done the long-term setup that this blog suggests is necessary for a great recommendation, a good one will likely be sufficient. 
- Polish your CV or resume using resources like [collegegrad.com/resumes](https://collegegrad.com/resumes) and templates from [Latex Templates](https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae).
- Write a paragraph about yourself, detailing your acquired skills, learning experiences, and passion for research or engineering. Use narrative examples to highlight your accomplishments ([Indeed Guide](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/how-to-write-about-yourself)).

### What to Expect
- After applying, expect a wait of several weeks before notification of funding and mentor matching. Some programs may notify applicants later.
- Internship specifics like housing, attendance policies, and dates vary. Check the program's FAQ for precise information, as some details might only be available post-acceptance.

### Tips and Tricks
- Thoroughly review application requirements before starting.
- Use your network to secure a mentor. Contact people at the desired institution or lab.
- Apply to multiple programs; preparedness with an application kit is key.
- Limit AI usage for CV/resume or application essays to spell checking and grammar.
- Craft and practice an elevator pitch ([Indeed Guide](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-give-an-elevator-pitch-examples)).
- Engage in discussions, ask questions, and build relationships during the internship.
- Stay connected with mentors and colleagues by sharing career updates.
- Remain flexible and open-minded to diverse internship opportunities.
- Evaluate career paths and set future goals.
- Attend talks and sessions to learn about ongoing projects and broaden interests.
- Enhance soft skills through effective communication and sharing technical knowledge.
- Overcome imposter syndrome; focus on your skills and potential.
- Establish a personal motto for motivation during challenges.
- Embrace the experience, explore the area, learn about the Labs, and network.
