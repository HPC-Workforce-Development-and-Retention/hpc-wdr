### Exascale Computing Project Introduction to HPC Boot Camp

I am serving as a mentor in the first Exascale Computing Project HPC Bootcamp. The idea behind this boot camp is to teach advanced computing techniques through projects rather than exercises. This approach makes sense when I recall that, of all the difficult things I learned in college or school, the ones that I still remember well enough to use were applied to projects, like my thesis. Usage brings memory and some level of mastery.

Our team of three Oak Rigde National Laboratory mentors is guiding 21 students organized into four teams, and we are deeply invested in their success. We will attempt to steer them through two projects analyzing a large dataset related to tracking power outages in the United States in 15-minute intervals over five years.

We have the assistance of two excellent peer mentors who are in the same career stage as our students but also have experience with advanced computing. Thinking back, I remember it being less intimidating to ask my peers questions than to ask my professors. I also recall that I learned well when I strove to answer my peersâ€™ questions. There is a strong mutual benefit to having peer mentors.

In total, there are 61 students working on six different projects prepared by National Lab staff and the Sustainable Horizons Institute. Each team has a peer mentor, and each project incorporates elements of HPC, big data, or AI.

The students come from a variety of academic backgrounds and are a mix of gradautes and undergradurates. Part of the motivation for this camp is to introduce High-Performance Computing into disciplines that don't typically use it. The camp also aims to serve as an onramp to computing careers.

The students have five days to complete the project. During that time, they also attend talks and tutorials designed to introduce them to High-Performance Computing and the research it enables. At the end of the week, the students will present their project outcomes in teams.
