### What is an Inclusive Minute** 

Inclusive practices are about making that extra effort to ensure everyone who wants to participate, can. Large, commercial organizations whose business depends on reach and growth are fully committed to inclusive practices.

An inclusive minute  is an inclusivity practice designed for teams to easily add to existing meeting agendas. The practice is intentionally kept small and informal to help minimize the potential for controversy as well as maximize the likelihood of uptake and adoption. The purpose is to raise awareness, inspire dialog and deeper thinking, and/or inform future action. Although rather modest in its aims, highlighting inclusivity regularly will sow seeds that can grow into larger cultural change.

While a minute is never enough time, we aim to characterize a practice other teams can easily follow and adopt into their existing agendas. While we are all impacted by inclusion issues, sometimes in deeply personal ways, we aim for a focus that relates primarily to a team’s existing work activities. While progress on inclusion is urgently needed, our modest aim here is simply to raise awareness and inspire further/deeper thought.

During regular meetings, a small portion (typically just a few minutes) of the agenda is set aside for a team member to share a factoid, event, resource, or experience at the nexus of inclusion and X. What is X?

If your team develops HPC software, X is HPC software development.
If your team develops online training content, X is online training content development.
If your team is an astrophysics team, X is astrophysics.
X is whatever topic your team comes together regularly to meet about. Whatever X is, it is likely there is no shortage of interesting content involving inclusion and X or inclusion and things with which X is closely associated. Keeping topics focused on the nexus of inclusion and X maximizes the relevance of the activity.
