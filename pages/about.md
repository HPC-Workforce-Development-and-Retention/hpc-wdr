### Who we are

The High Performance Computing (HPC) Workforce Development and Retention (WDR) Action group was established by the  Exascale Computing Project’s Broadening Participation Initiative as part of a sustainable plan to recruit and retain a diverse HPC workforce by fostering a supportive and inclusive culture within the computing sciences at DOE national laboratories. The large muti-lab collaboration of ECP serves as a good starting point for collecting and disseminating best practices for workforce development and retention, and cultural development. 


### Why we formed

The Department of Energy’s Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program noted that the DOE National Laboratories face workforce recruitment and retention challenges in the fields within the Computing Sciences that are relevant to their missions.  Future projections indicate an increasing workforce gap and a continued underrepresentation of minorities and females in the workforce unless there is an intervention.


This website serves as a place to collect and archive resources and best practices for workforce development and retention.
