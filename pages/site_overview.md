## What is here?

One purpose of this site is to help connect and inform the computational science and high-performance computing communities on topics related to workforce development and retention. We welcome contributions of blogs, best practices and events to these pages. 
However, the material must be in scope.

## Scope of content

The exact scope of relevant content will evolve as we learn more about community interests. However, the following guidelines should be useful:

## In-scope content
* General issues or experiences in workforce development and retention that overlap with common challenges faced in the computational science and high-performance computing communities.
* Best practices for workforce development and retention in the computational science and high-performance computing.
* Characterization of challenges and solutions for workforce development that may be particularly valuable to the computational science and high-performance computing communities.

## Highlight connections to computational science and high-performance computing
* How your topic intersects with themes that are of particular interest to computational science and high-performance computing.  Examples include practices or examples of running an inclusive research group or project team that uses HPC or builds scientific software, best practices for mentoring and training for scientific computing professions, and experiences or best practices related to developing and retaining a robust computing workforce. 
* Why your topic could be of particular interest to computational science and high-performance computing communities.

## Out-of-scope content
* Tools, processes, and practices that have little in common with workforce development and retention or that could not be applied to fostering an inclusive, equitable and diverse scientific computing workforce.
* Content that is deemed incomplete or biased, as determined by the HPC-WDR leaders.
